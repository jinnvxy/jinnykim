            This project explores the idea of platform and community through the city of Irvine, the place where I grew up. 
            Irvine is often recognized only as the home of UCI, but for me it holds personal memories, quiet neighborhoods, 
            hidden cafés, and everyday routines that rarely appear on maps. I interviewed local residents to learn about the 
            places they love most — parks, shops, streets, and small corners that define their experience of the city. 
            Their responses became the foundation of this work. I layered these voices with my own perspective and translated them 
            into a Google Map system using custom icons and quotes, allowing users to navigate Irvine through the stories of the people
            who live there and to discover the city beyond its surface.
